# Managing small football club database (project done at school) 

This project is aimed to manage the database of a small football club with SQL(Oracle).
The database is composed by 7 entities : Adherent, Team, League, Stadium, Opponent, Training and Game.

By managing this database the club can have information about all the activities. 
For example the club could know which adherent plays which game at which stadium.

In this small project you could find how I created the tables respecting the integrity constraints,
how I programmed PL/SQL procedure,packages and trigger and finally how I tested them on the tables.
